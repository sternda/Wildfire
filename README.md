Project Proposal
For my final project, I would like to create a web map analyzing wildfire in Oregon. This will focus on wildfire as a whole over time in the state of Oregon, not any particular fire. I have found data that I would like to present on historical fires, as well as fires started by humans specifically. The target audience for this project will be naturalists, wildland firefighters, and researchers studying fire characteristics. The USGS website has most of the data I will need for this project, and Oregon.gov also has fire data resources I can use. There is no shortage of data on wildfires on the internet currently.
